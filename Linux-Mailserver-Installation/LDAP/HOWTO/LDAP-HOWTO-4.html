<H2><A NAME="4"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Running the LDAP Server</A></H2>

<P>Slapd can be run in two different modes, stand-alone or from inetd(8). Stand-alone operation is recommended, especially if you are using the LDBM backend. This allows the
backend to take advantage of caching and avoids concurrency problems with the LDBM index files. If you are running only a PASSWD or SHELL backend, running from inetd is an option. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="4.1"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Command Line Options</A>
</H2>

<P>Slapd supports the following command-line options. 
<P>-d &lt;level&gt; | ? 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This option sets the slapd debug level to &lt;level&gt;. When level is a `?' character, the various debugging 
levels are printed and slapd exits, regardless of any other options you give it. Current debugging levels are 

1 trace function calls 
2 debug packet handling 
4 heavy trace debugging 
8 connection management 
16 print out packets sent and received 
32 search filter processing 
64 configuration file processing 
128 access control list processing 
256 stats log connections/operations/results 
512 stats log entries sent 
1024 print communication with shell backends 
2048 print entry parsing debugging 
65535 enable all debugging 

Debugging levels are additive. That is, if you want to trace function calls and watch the config file being
processed, you would set level to the sum of those two levels (in this case, 65). Consult the &lt;ldap.h&gt; file
for more details. 
Note that slapd must have been compiled with -DLDAP_DEBUG defined for any debugging information beyond the 
two stats levels to be available.

<P>-f &lt;filename&gt; 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This option specifies an alternate configuration file for slapd. 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>-i 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This option tells slapd that it is running from inetd instead of as a stand-alone server. On the following section
about running slapd from inetd you will find more details. 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>-p &lt;port&gt; 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This option specifies an alternate TCP port on which slapd should listen for connections. The default port 
is 389. 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="42"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Running slapd as a Stand Alone Daemon</A>
</H2>

<P>In general, slapd is run like this: 
<P>$(ETCDIR)/slapd [&lt;option&gt;]* 
<P>where ETCDIR has the value you gave in the Make-common file or configure script during the pre-build configuration, and &lt;option&gt; is one of the options described above.
Unless you have specified a debugging level, slapd will automatically fork and detach itself from its controlling terminal and run in the background. Any of the options given above
can be given to slapd to point it at a different configuration file, listen on another port, etc. 
<P>See this example of starting slapd : 
<P>$(ETCDIR)/slapd -f /home/malere/myslapd.conf -d 255 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Running slapd from inetd</A>
</H2>

<P>First, make sure that running from inetd(8) is a good idea. If you are using the LDBM backend, it is not. If you are in a high-volume environment, the overhead of running from
inetd also makes it a bad idea. Otherwise, you may proceed with the two steps necessary. 
<P>Step 1 is to add a line like this to your /etc/services file: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ldap 389 # ldap directory service 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Step 2 is to add a line like this to your /etc/inetd.conf file: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ldap stream tcp nowait nobody $(ETCDIR)/slapd slapd -i 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>where ETCDIR has the value you gave it in the Make-common file or configure script during pre-build configuration. Finally, send inetd a HUP signal, and you should be all set.
