UW IMAP software documentation</A><BR><PRE> 
 Q: Is this software Y2K compliant?
 A: Please read the files Y2K and calendar.txt.
 
 
 Q: How do I configure the IMAP and POP servers?
 Q: I built and installed the servers according to the BUILD instructions.
     It can't be that easy.  Don't I need to write a config file?
 A: For ordinary "vanilla" UNIX systems, this software is plug and play; just
     build it, install it, and you're done.  If you have a modified system,
     then you may want to do additional work; most of this is to a single
     source code file (env_unix.c on UNIX systems).  Read the file CONFIG
     for more details.
    Yes, it's that easy.
 
 
 Q: I have an NT system.  Why isn't it plug and play for me?
 A: There is no standard for how mail is stored on NT; no single standard
     SMTP server.  So there's no default by which to make assumptions.  As
     the software is set up, it assumes that the each user has an NT login
     account and private home directory, and that mail is stored on that
     home directory as files in one of the popular UNIX formats.  It also
     assumes that there is some tool equivalent to inetd on UNIX that does
     the TCP/IP listening and server startup.
    Basically, unless you're an email software hacker, you probably want
     to look elsewhere if you want IMAP/POP servers for NT.
 
 
 Q: Can I set up a POP or IMAP server on Windows 95 and 98?
 A: Yes.  Refer to the NT specific notes in files CONFIG and BUILD.  Also,
     you *must* set up CRAM-MD5 authentication, as described in md5.txt.
     There is no file access control on Windows 9x, so you probably will
     have to do modifications to env_unix.c to prevent people from hacking
     others' mail.
 
 
 Q: I've heard that IMAP servers are insecure.  Is this true?
 A: There are no known security problems in this version of the IMAP
     toolkit, including the IMAP and POP servers.  The IMAP and POP
     servers limit what can be done while not logged in, and as part of
     the login process discard all privileges except those of the user.
    There were buffer overflow vulnerabilities in earlier versions which
     were used to mount widespread attacks against unlogged-in (and hence
     root-privileged) servers.  These problems were fixed years ago;
     unfortunately "Internet folklore" and old versions tend to persist
     long after problems are fixed.
    There is every reason to believe that the bad guys are engaged in an
     ongoing effort to find vulnerabilities in the IMAP toolkit; but to
     the best of our knowledge these efforts have been futile in recent
     years.  Judging from CERT reports, they've had much greater success
     in other software, so it does not appear to be an ongoing problem
     for the IMAP toolkit.
    We are unhappy that any vulnerabilities existed in past versions, and
     we're doing our best to keep the IMAP toolkit free of vulnerabilities.
 
 
 Q: What does the syslog message:
      imap/tcp server failing (looping)
     mean?  When it happens, IMAP service shuts down.  How can I fix this?
 Q: What does the syslog message:
      pop3/tcp server failing (looping)
     mean?  When it happens, POP3 service shuts down.  How can I fix this?
 A: The error message "server failing (looping), service terminated" is not
     from either the IMAP or POP servers.  Instead, it comes from inetd, the
     daemon which listens for TCP connections to a number of servers,
     including the IMAP and POP servers.
    inetd has a limit of 40 new server sessions per minute for any particular
     service.  If more than 40 sessions are initiated in a minute, inetd will
     issue the "failing (looping), service terminated" message and shut
     down the service for 10 minutes. 
    For larger server systems, the limit of 40 is much too low.  The limit was
     established many years ago when a system typically only ran a few dozen
     servers.
    On some versions of inetd, such as the one distributed with most versions
     of Linux, you can modify the /etc/inetd.conf file to have a larger number
     of servers by appending a colon followed by a number after the "nowait"
     word for the server entry.  For example, if your existing /etc/inetd.conf
     line reads:
      imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/imapd imapd
     try changing it to be:
      imap    stream  tcp     nowait:100  root    /usr/etc/imapd imapd
     Another example (using TCP wrappers):
      imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  imapd
     try changing it to be:
      imap    stream  tcp     nowait:100  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  imapd
     to increase the limit to 100 sessions/minute.
    Before making this change, please read the information in "man inetd" to
     determine whether or not your inetd has this feature.  If it does not, and
     you make this change, the likely outcome is that you will disable IMAP
     service entirely.
   Another way to fix this problem is to edit the inetd.c source code
    (provided by your UNIX system vendor) to set higher limits, rebuild inetd,
    install the new binary, and reboot your system.  This should only be done
    by a UNIX system expert.  In the inetd.c source code, the limits TOOMANY
    (normally 40) is the maximum number of new server sessions permitted per
    minute, and RETRYTIME (normally 600) is the number of seconds inetd will
    shut down the server after it exceeds TOOMANY.
 
 
 
 Q: What does the message:
      Mailbox vulnerable - directory /var/spool/mail must have 1777 protection
     mean?  How can I fix this?
 A: In order to update a mailbox in the default UNIX format, it is necessary
     to create a lock file to prevent the mailer from delivering mail while
     an update is in progress.  Some systems use a directory protection of
     775, requiring that all mail handling programs be setgid mail; or of
     755, requiring that all mail handling programs be setuid root.
    The IMAP toolkit does not run with any special privileges, and we plan
     to keep it that way.  It is antithetical to the concept of a toolkit
     if users can't write their own programs to use it.  Also, we've had
     enough bad experiences with security bugs while running privileged;
     the IMAP and POP servers have to be root when not logged in, in order
     to be able to log themselves in.  We don't want to go any deeper down
     that slippery slope.
    Directory protection 1777 is secure enough on most well-managed systems.
     If you can't trust your users with a 1777 mail spool (petty harassment
     is about the limit of the abuse exposure), then you have much worse
     problems then that.
    If you absolutely insist upon requiring privileges to create a lock file,
     external file locking can be done via a setgid mail program named
     /etc/mlock (this is defined by LOCKPGM in the c-client Makefile).  If
     the toolkit is unable to create a <MAILBOX>.lock file in the directory
     by itself, it will try to call mlock to do it.  We do not recommend
     doing this for performance reasons.
    A sample mlock program is part of the imap-utils package:
      ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z
     We have tried to make this sample program reasonably secure, but it
     has not been thoroughly audited.
 
 
 Q: Can I use SSL?
 Q: Can I use TLS and the STARTTLS facility?
 A: Yes.  imap-2000 supports SSL client functionality for IMAP, POP3, SMTP,
    and NNTP; and SSL and TLS server functionality for IMAP and POP3.
    This is available on UNIX, and 32-bit Windows.

    UNIX SSL build requires that a third-party software package, OpenSSL, be
    installed on the system first.  Read the SSLBUILD documentation for more
    information. SSL is supported via undocumented Microsoft interfaces in
    Windows 9x and NT4 and via standard interfaces in Windows 2000 and
    Windows Millenium.



 
 Q: Can I use CRAM-MD5 authentication?
 Q: Can I use APOP authentication?
 A: CRAM-MD5 authentication is enabled in the IMAP and POP3 client code on
     all platforms.  Read md5.txt to learn how to set up CRAM-MD5 and APOP
     authentication on UNIX and NT servers.
    There is no support for APOP client authentication.
 
 
 Q: Can I use RPOP authentication?
 A: There is no support for RPOP authentication.
 
 
 Q: Can I use Kerberos V5?
 A: Kerberos V5 is supported if you build the software with
     EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS=GSS set, e.g.
      make slx EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS=gss
 
 
 Q: Can I use Kerberos V4?
 A: Kerberos V4 is not supported.  Kerberos V4 client-only contributed code
     is available as:
      ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/kerberos4-patches.tar.Z
     This is a patchkit which must be applied to the IMAP toolkit according
     to the instructions in the patchkit's README.  I can not promise that
     this code works.
 
 
 Q: Can I use PAM for plaintext passwords?
 A: On Linux systems, use the lnp port, e.g.
      make lnp
    On Solaris systems and other systems with defective PAM implementations,
     build with PASSWDTYPE=pmb, e.g.
      make sol PASSWDTYPE=pmb
    On all other systems, build with PASSWDTYPE=pam, e.g
      make foo PASSWDTYPE=pam
    If you build with PASSWDTYPE=pam and authentication does not work, try
     rebuilding (after a "make clean") with PASSWDTYPE=pmb.
 
 
 Q: Can I use AFS for plaintext passwords?
 A: Build with PASSWDTYPE=afs, e.g
      make sol PASSWDTYPE=afs
 
 
 Q: Can I use DCE for plaintext passwords?
 A: Build with PASSWDTYPE=dce, e.g
      make sol PASSWDTYPE=dce
 
 
 Q: Can I use the CRAM-MD5 database for plaintext passwords?
 A: The CRAM-MD5 password database is automatically used for plaintext
     password if it exists.
    Note that this gives you the worst of both worlds -- plaintext passwords
     over the network and plaintext passwords stored on the server!  You
     probably don't want to do this unless all access is through SSL.  It
     is recommended that you disable plaintext passwords (see the next
     question).
 
 
 Q: Can I disable plaintext passwords?
 A: Server-level plaintext passwords can be disabled by setting
     PASSWDTYPE=nul, e.g.
      make lnx EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS=gss PASSWDTYPE=nul
    Note that you must specify at least one EXTRAAUTHENTICATOR, otherwise
     it will not be possible to log in to the server.
    When plaintext passwords are disabled, the IMAP server will advertise
     the LOGINDISABLED capability and the POP3 server will not advertise
     the USER capability.
 
 
 Q: Is there support for S/Key or OTP?
 A: There is currently no support for S/Key or OTP.  There may be an OTP
      SASL authenticator available from the OTP folks.
 
 
 Q: Is there support for NTLM or SPA?
 A: There is currently no support for NTML or SPA, nor are there any plans
     to add such support.  In general, we avoid vendor-specific mechanisms.
 
 
 Q: Is there support for qmail and the maildir format?
 A: There is no support for qmail or the maildir format in our distribution,
     nor are there any plans to add such support.  Some third parties offer
     add-ons drivers that purport to support maildir format.  We can't vouch
     for their reliablity or performance.
 
 
 Q: How can I enable anonymous IMAP logins?
 A: Create the file /etc/anonymous.newsgroups.  At the present time, this
     file should be empty.  This will permit IMAP logins as anonymous as
     well as the ANONYMOUS SASL authenticator.  Anonymous users have access
     to mailboxes in the #news., #ftp/, and #public/ namespaces only.
 
 
 Q: How do I set up an alert message that each IMAP user will see?
 A: Create the file /etc/imapd.alert with the text of the message.  This
     text should be kept to one line if possible.  Note that this will
     cause an alert to every IMAP user every time they initiate an IMAP
     session, so it should only be used for critical messages.
 
 
 Q: Why does mail disappear even though I set "keep mail on server"?
 Q: Why do I get the message
      Moved ##### bytes of new mail to /home/user/mbox from /var/spool/mail/mbox
     and why did this happen?
 A: This is probably caused by the mbox driver.  If the file "mbox" exists on
     the user's home directory and is in UNIX mailbox format, then when INBOX
     is opened this file will be selected as INBOX instead of the mail spool
     file.  Messages will be automatically transferred from the mail spool file
     into the mbox file.
    To disable this behavior, delete "mbox" from the EXTRADRIVERS list in the
     top-level Makefile and rebuild.  Note that if you do this, users won't
     be able to access the messages that have already been moved to mbox
     unless they open mbox instead of INBOX.
 
 
 Q: What is the status of internationalization?
 A: The IMAP toolkit is partially internationalized and multilingualized.
     In particular, searching is supported in the following charsets:
      US-ASCII, UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4,
      ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9,
      ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14, ISO-8859-15,
      KOI8-R, KOI8-U (alias KOI8-RU), TIS-620, VISCII,
      ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-KR, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-JP-1, ISO-2022-JP-2,
      GB2312 (alias CN-GB), CN-GB-12345, BIG5 (alias CN-BIG5),
      EUC-JP, EUC-KR, Shift_JIS
     All ISO-2022-?? charsets are treated identically, and support ASCII,
      JIS Roman, hankaku katakana, ISO-8859-[1 - 10], TIS, GB 2312, JIS X 0208,
      JIS X 0212, KSC 5601, and planes 1 and 2 of CNS 11643.
     EUC-JP includes support for JIS X 0212 and hankaku katakana.
     There is no support for localization (e.g. non-English error messages)
      at the present time, but such support is planned.
 
 
 Q: Why isn't it showing the local host name as a fully-qualified domain
     name?
 Q: Why is the local host name in the From/Sender/Message-ID headers of
     outgoing mail not coming out as a fully-qualified domain name?
 A: Your UNIX system is misconfigured.  The entry for your system in
     /etc/hosts must have the fully-qualified domain name first, e.g.
 	105.69.1.234	bombastic.blurdybloop.com bombastic
    A common mistake of novice system administrators is to have the
     short name first, e.g.
 	105.69.1.234	bombastic bombastic.blurdybloop.com
     or to omit the fully qualified domain name entirely, e.g.
 	105.69.1.234	bombastic
    The result of this is that when the IMAP toolkit does a gethostbyname()
     call to get the fully-qualified domain name, it would get "bombastic"
     instead of "bombastic.blurdybloop.com".
    On some systems, a configuration file (typically named /etc/svc.conf,
     /etc/netsvc.conf, or /etc/nsswitch.conf) can be used to configure the
     system to use the domain name system (DNS) instead of /etc/hosts, so
     it doesn't matter if /etc/hosts is misconfigured.
    Check the man pages for gethostbyname, hosts, svc, and/or netsvc for
     more information.
    Unfortunately, certain vendors, most notably SUN, have failed to
     make this clear in their documentation.  Most of SUN's documentation
     assumes a corporate network that is not connected to the Internet.
    net.folklore once (late 1980s) held that the proper procedure was to
     append the results of getdomainname(), and some versions of sendmail
     configuration files were distributed that did this.  This was
     incorrect; the string returned from getdomainname() is the Yellow
     Pages (a.k.a NIS) domain name, which is a completely different
     (albeit unfortunately named) entity from an Internet domain.  These
     were often fortuitously the same string, except when they weren't.
     Frequently, domain names would be spuriously doubled, e.g.
     "bombastic.blurdybloop.com.blurdybloop.com".  This practice has been
     thoroughly discredited for many years, but folklore dies hard.
 
 
 Q: What does the message:
      Mailbox is open by another process, access is readonly
     mean?
 A: A problem occurred in applying a lock to a /tmp lock file.  Either some
     other program has the mailbox open and won't relenquish it, or
     something is wrong with the protection of /tmp or the lock.
 
 
 Q: What does the syslog message:
      Mailbox lock file /tmp/.600.1df3 open failure: Permission denied
     mean?
 A: This usually means that some "helpful" person has protected /tmp so
     that it is no longer world-writeable.  /tmp must be world-writeable
     because lots of applications use it for scratch space.  To fix this,
     do "chmod 1777 /tmp" as root.
    If that isn't the answer, check the protection of the named file.  If
     it is something other than 666, then either someone is hacking or
     some "helpful" person modified the code to have a different default
     lock file protection.
 
 
 Q: Those /tmp lock files are protected 666, is that really right?
 A: Yes.  Shared mailboxes won't work otherwise.  Also, you get into
     accidental denial of service problems (see the previous FAQs)
     with old lock files left lying around; this happens fairly
     frequently.
    The deliberate mischief that can be caused by fiddling with the
     lock files is small-scale; harassment level at most.  There are
     many -- and much more effective -- other ways of harassing another
     user on UNIX.  It's usually not difficult to determine the culprit.
    Before worrying about deliberate mischief, worry first about things
     happening by accident!
 
 
 Q: What does the message:
      Can't get write access to mailbox, access is readonly
      mean?
 A: The mailbox file is write-protected against you.
