The imap.tar.Z on this directory represents a snapshot of my development
sources.  It is updated very frequently.

At the time of this writing (8 July 1999), it points to the beta
imap-4.6.BETA.tar.Z.

Old, permanently-frozen versions of the IMAP toolkit are on the old/
subdirectory.  In many cases, these match what were distributed with a
Pine release; for example, imap-4.5 was distributed with Pine 4.10.
Note that all permanently-frozen versions have known bugs.
